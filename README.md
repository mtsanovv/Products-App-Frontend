# TechStore-App-Frontend

Frontend UI for the Java Spring REST app that has to maintain users and products, located here: [TechStore-App-Backend](https://github.com/mtsanovv/TechStore-App-Backend)

## Requirements
- MDB Pro v4.8.10 (not provided with this repository as it is out of the License Agreement with MDBoostrap)

## Configuring the frontend
- Place the MDB Pro v4.8.10 assets inside the mdb folder (css, js, font and all the other folders).
- Go to the ```scripts``` directory and edit the ```config.js``` file to point to the TechStore REST API.

## Notes
- Always use HTTPS for requests to the REST API because it uses basic HTTP authentication (and that thing is insanely vulnerable over insecure connections).
- The MDB Pro v4.8.10 License is personal, licensed to 1 person (me) and unlimited projects of mine. In order to have this frontend UI operational, **you need to purchase a licence from MDB.**

## Credits
- Design created with [Material Design Bootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com)
