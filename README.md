# TechStore-App-Frontend

Frontend UI for the Java Spring REST app that has to maintain users and products, located here: [TechStore-App-Backend](https://github.com/mtsanovv/TechStore-App-Backend)

## Requirements
- MDB Pro v4.8.10 (not provided with this repository as it is out of the License Agreement with MDBoostrap)

## Configuring the frontend
- Place the MDB Pro v4.8.10 assets inside the mdb folder (css, js and other stuff).
- Go to the ```scripts``` directory and edit the ```config.js``` file to point to the TechStore REST API.

## Notes
- Always use HTTPS for requests to the REST API because it uses basic HTTP authentication (and that thing is insanely vulnerable over insecure connections).
- CSRF is disabled: this project was not made to be public. In order for CSRF to be implemented properly, the dynamic forms content should've been generated by Thymeleaf or anything else that could insert dynamically a CSRF protection token into the forms, without it being passed over http.
- The MDB Pro v4.8.10 License is personal, licensed to 1 person (me) and unlimited projects of mine.
